#QuizCraft

1. Overview

QuizCraft is a client-side React web application that transforms any input text into an interactive study resource using powerful NLP models from Hugging Face. It is designed for students, educators, and self-learners who want to quickly digest content, test their understanding, and export study materials for offline use.
Unlike traditional quiz-making tools, QuizCraft uses AI to automatically generate:
 a.Concise summaries of large text passages
 b.Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with contextually relevant and meaningful distractors
 c.Fill-in-the-blank (FIB) style questions to reinforce recall
 d.PDF exports containing the summary and all generated questions

All processing is done client-side, ensuring a fast, secure, and privacy-friendly experience. The app does not require any backend server, making it lightweight and easy to run locally with minimal setup.
Key Highlights:
 a.Fast & lightweight: Built purely with React and runs entirely in-browser
 b.Privacy-focused: No data is stored or transmitted beyond the Hugging Face inference request
 c.Powered by NLP: Uses state-of-the-art transformer models via Hugging Face API
 d.Export-ready: One-click PDF export for printing or sharing your quiz materials

QuizCraft aims to simplify learning and revision by making it effortless to convert raw information into interactive content that promotes better understanding and retention.
